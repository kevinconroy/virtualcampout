If you have a tent already, this may be a great time to use it. You can either camp out in your backyard, or with your parent's permission, you can set up your tent inside.  

To setup a tent inside:

# Make space for the tent. If necessary, move some furniture and pick up toys. There should be enough clear floor-space that the only thing the tent touches is the floor.
# Set down two or three layers of blankets for padding.
# Lay the tent on the floor, centered over the blankets. Position the tent so it opens up to a large access area with adequate room to get in and out comfortably.
# Put the support poles together. Pass them through the tent guides or sleeve, or snap them into the grommets. Follow the manufacturerâ€™s directions for this. Some need to be assembled in a particular order.
# Set the poles in the keys at the bottom of the tent. This pulls the tent up into its shape.
